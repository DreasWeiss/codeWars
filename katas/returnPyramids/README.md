The task is very simple.

You must to return pyramids. Given a number n you print a pyramid with n floors

For example , given a n=4 you must to print this pyramid:

```
   /\
  /  \
 /    \
/______\ 
```
   
Other example, given a n=6 you must to print this pyramid:

```
     /\
    /  \
   /    \
  /      \
 /        \
/__________\
```
Another example, given a n=10, you must to print this pyramid:

```
         /\
        /  \
       /    \
      /      \
     /        \
    /          \
   /            \
  /              \
 /                \

```
Note: a line feed character is needed at the end of the string. Case n=0 should so return "\n".
