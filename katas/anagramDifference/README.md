Given two words, how many letters do you have to remove from them to make them anagrams?

Example
```
First word : c od e w ar s (4 letters removed)
Second word : ha c k er r a nk (6 letters removed)
Result : 10
```
Hints

- A word is an anagram of another word if they have the same letters (usually in a different order).
- Do not worry about case. All inputs will be lowercase.
