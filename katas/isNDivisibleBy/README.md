[my solution](./kata.js)

Create a function that checks if the first argument n is divisible by all other arguments (return true if no other arguments)

Example:

```
(6,1,3)--> true because 6 is divisible by 1 and 3
(12,2)--> true because 12 is divisible by 2
(100,5,4,10,25,20)--> true
(12,7)--> false because 12 is not divisible by 7
```
