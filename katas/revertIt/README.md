You have to create a function named reverseIt.

Write your function so that in the case a string or a number is passed in as the data , you will return the data in reverse order. If the data is any other type, return it as it is.

Examples of inputs and subsequent outputs:

```
"Hello" -> "olleH"

"314159" -> "951413"

[1,2,3] -> [1,2,3]
```
