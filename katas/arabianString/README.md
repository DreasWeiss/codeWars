You must create a method that can convert a string from any format into PascalCase. This must support symbols too.

Don't presume the separators too much or you could be surprised.

For example: (Input --> Output)
```
"example name" --> "ExampleName"
"your-NaMe-here" --> "YourNameHere"
"testing ABC" --> "TestingAbc"
```
