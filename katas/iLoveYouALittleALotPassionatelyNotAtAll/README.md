<p>Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:</p>
<ol>
<li>"I love you"</li>
<li>"a little"</li>
<li>"a lot"</li>
<li>"passionately"</li>
<li>"madly"</li>
<li>"not at all"</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with <code>"I love you"</code> for 7 petals, <code>"a little"</code> for 8 petals and so on.</p>
<p>When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.</p>
