Create a function which compares two probabilities, returning true if the first one is most likely otherwise false.

For this exercise probability is expressed as two numbers separated by a colon e.g. a probability of 1 in 3 will be 1:3.

So:
```
Input: ('1:3','1:2') - returns false as 1 in 3 is less likely than 1 in 2.
```
