<p>Fellow code warrior, we need your help! We seem to have lost one of our sequence elements, and we need your help to retrieve it! </p>
<p>Our sequence given was supposed to contain all of the integers from 0 to 9 (in no particular order), but one of them seems to be missing.</p>
<p>Write a function that accepts a sequence of unique integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and returns the missing element. </p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<pre><code>[0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4] --&gt; 8
[9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1] --&gt; 3
</code></pre>
