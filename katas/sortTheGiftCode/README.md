<p>Santa's senior gift organizer Elf developed a way to represent up to 26 gifts by assigning a unique alphabetical character to each gift. After each gift was assigned a character, the gift organizer Elf then joined the characters to form the gift ordering code. </p>
<p>Santa asked his organizer to order the characters in alphabetical order, but the Elf fell asleep from consuming too much hot chocolate and candy canes! Can you help him out?</p>
<h3 id="sort-the-gift-code">Sort the Gift Code</h3>
<p>Write a function called <code>sortGiftCode</code>/<code>sort_gift_code</code>/<code>SortGiftCode</code> that accepts a string containing up to 26 unique alphabetical characters, and returns a string containing the same characters in alphabetical order.</p>

<pre><code>"abcdef"                      -- =&gt; "abcdef"
"pqksuvy"                     -- =&gt; "kpqsuvy"
"zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"  -- =&gt; "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
</code></pre>
