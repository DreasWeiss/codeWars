[my solution](./kata.js)

In this kata you are given a string for example:
```
"example(unwanted thing)example"
```
Your task is to remove everything inside the parentheses as well as the parentheses themselves.

The example above would return:
```
"exampleexample"
```
Notes

Other than parentheses only letters and spaces can occur in the string. Don't worry about other brackets like "[]" and "{}" as these will never appear.
There can be multiple parentheses.
The parentheses can be nested.
