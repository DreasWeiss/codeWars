[my solution](./kata.js)

In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

```
"Hello!" => "Holle!"
"Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
"Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
```
For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.

Good luck!
